# Spring Boot Practice

I'm utilizing this repository as a playground to dive into the fundamentals of Spring Boot and incorporate them into my future projects. Opting for Spring Boot was a natural choice due to its Java foundation, a language I've extensively worked with during my education at Utah State University and Bridgerland Technical College.

My primary objective is to grasp the intricacies of developing a robust RESTful API. I'm focusing on mastering the fundamental principles of API development, including implementing database connectivity and navigating through entity relationships such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.
